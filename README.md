# BALDWIN_Final_Project
Final project for Bio 668.

# Chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) data analysis
This script will check for normality of the CF data.
This script will then run an ANOVA on the final day of my CF data.
This script will also create a boxplot that divides the CF data by treatment group and day so you can see how the fluorescence changes over the 21 days. 
This will also create a table of all of the CF values for each day and treatment, and color code it by day. 

# Leaf Area Data
This script will also take the leaf area data and make a boxplot of the differences in leaf area from day 0 to day 14 for the first four plants in each treatment. The growth difference was measured using imageJ and imported into the R script.
